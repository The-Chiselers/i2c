\subsection{Tests}
The test bench generates a number (default is 2) configurations of the
I2C that are highly randomized. The user can run the full test-suite  
with n-configurations using "sbt "test" -DtestName="regression"".

User can also run individual tests or test groups by substituting "regression" with
the relevant test name. A description of the tests is below:

\subsection{Toggle Coverage}
Current Score: 92.41\%

All inputs and outputs are checked to insure each toggle at least once. If coverage is enabled
during core instantiation, a cumulative coverage report of all tests is generated under ./out/cov/verliog.

Exceptions are higher bits of the \emph{PADDR}, \emph{PWDATA}, and \emph{PRDATA}
which are intended to be static during each simulation. These signals are
excluded from coverage checks.

\subsection{Code Coverage}
Current Score: 83.58\%

Code coverage for all tests can be generated as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ sbt coverage test -DtestName="allTests"
  $ sbt coverageReport
  $ python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory target/scoverage-report/
  View report on local host: http://localhost:8000/index.html
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Running simulation}

Simulations can be run directly from the command prompt as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  $ sbt test -DtestName="allTests"
\end{verbatim}

or from make as follows:

\texttt{\$ make test}

\subsection{Viewing the waveforms}

The simulation generates an FST file that can be viewed using a waveform viewer. The command to view the waveform is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ gtkwave ./out/test/i2c.fst
\end{verbatim}
