\section{Synthesis}

\subsection{Area}
The I2C module has been synthesized in various configurations. The following results are representative of what users should expect in their technology.

\input{../../out/doc/synth_sta.tex}

Note that enabling formal verification adds minimal overhead to the design but provides significant quality assurance benefits.

\subsection{SDC File}
An \texttt{.sdc} file is generated to provide synthesis and static timing analysis tools guidance for synthesis.

The \texttt{I2C.sdc} file is emitted and found in the \texttt{./syn} directory.

\subsection{Multicycle Paths}
There are no multicycle paths in the current design. The I2C module is fully synchronous with respect to the system clock.
